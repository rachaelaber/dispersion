	abstract = {All World Health Organization regions have set measles elimination goals. We find that as countries progress toward these goals, they undergo predictable changes in the size and frequency of measles outbreaks. A country’s position on this “canonical path” is driven by both measles control activities and demographic factors, which combine to change the effective size of the measles-susceptible population, thereby driving the country through theoretically established dynamic regimes. Further, position on the path to elimination provides critical information for guiding vaccination efforts, such as the age profile of susceptibility, that could only otherwise be obtained through costly field studies or sophisticated analysis. Equipped with this information, countries can gain insight into their current and future measles epidemiology and select appropriate strategies to more quickly achieve elimination goals.},

	abstract = {Transmission heterogeneity is a notable feature of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemics, though previous efforts to estimate how heterogeneity changes over time are limited. Using contact tracing data, we compared the epidemiology of SARS and COVID-19 infection in Hong Kong in 2003 and 2020-21 and estimated time-varying transmission heterogeneity (kt) by fitting negative binomial models to offspring distributions generated across variable observation windows. kt fluctuated over time for both COVID-19 and SARS on a continuous scale though SARS exhibited significantly greater (p\&amp;thinsp;\&amp;lt;\&amp;thinsp;0.001) heterogeneity compared to COVID-19 overall and in-time. For COVID-19, kt declined over time and was significantly associated with increasingly stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions though similar evidence for SARS was inconclusive. Underdetection of sporadic COVID-19 cases led to a moderate overestimation of kt, indicating COVID-19 heterogeneity of could be greater than observed. Time-varying or real-time estimates of transmission heterogeneity could become a critical indicator for epidemic intelligence in the future.},

	abstract = {Two key linked questions in population dynamics are the relative importance of noise vs. density-dependent nonlinearities and the limits on temporal predictability of population abundance. We propose that childhood microparasitic infections, notably measles, provide an unusually suitable empirical and theoretical test bed for addressing these issues. We base our analysis on a new mechanistic time series model for measles, the TSIR model, which captures the mechanistic essence of epidemic dynamics. The model, and parameter estimates based on short-term fits to prevaccination measles time series for 60 towns and cities in England and Wales, is introduced in a companion paper. Here, we explore how well the model predicts the long-term dynamics of measles and the balance between noise and determinism, as a function of population size. The TSIR model captures the basic dynamical features of the long-term pattern of measles epidemics in large cities remarkably well (based on time and frequency domain analyses). In particular, the model illustrates the impact of secular increases in birth rates, which cause a transition from biennial to annual dynamics. The model also captures the observed increase in epidemic irregularity with decreasing population size and the onset of local extinction below a critical community size. Decreased host population size is shown to be associated with an increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The interaction between nonlinearity and noise is explored using local Lyapunov exponents (LLE). These testify to the high level of stability of the biennial attractor in large cities. Irregularities are due to the limit cycle evolving with changing human birth rates and not due to complex dynamics. The geometry of the dynamics (sign and magnitude of the LLEs across phase space) is similar in the cities and the smaller urban areas. The qualitative difference in dynamics between small and large host communities is that demographic and extinction-recolonization stochasticities are much more influential in the former. The regional dynamics can therefore only be understood in terms of a core-satellite metapopulation structure for this host-enemy system. We also make a preliminary exploration of the model's ability to predict the dynamic consequences of measles vaccination.},

	abstract = {We propose a new statistical test for assessing differential gene expression using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Commonly used probability distributions, such as binomial or Poisson, cannot appropriately model the count variability in RNA-Seq data due to overdispersion. The small sample size that is typical in this type of data also prevents the uncritical use of tools derived from large-sample asymptotic theory. The test we propose is based on the NBP parameterization of the negative binomial distribution. It extends an exact test proposed by Robinson and Smyth (2007, 2008). In one version of Robinson and Smyth’s test, a constant dispersion parameter is used to model the count variability between biological replicates. We introduce an additional parameter to allow the dispersion parameter to depend on the mean. Our parametric method complements nonparametric regression approaches for modeling the dispersion parameter. We apply the test we propose to an Arabidopsis data set and a range of simulated data sets. The results show that the test is simple, powerful and reasonably robust against departures from model assumptions.},
