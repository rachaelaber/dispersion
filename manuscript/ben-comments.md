This is a todo and changelog. I will check the boxes of things I have already done

 - [x] the title is accurate and reads well but part of me wonders if it is too specific (I am guilty of sometimes making titles to general). I proposed something more general

- [x] increase the size of figs so they span the width of the page

- [x] put theta on a log10 scale in fig 2. It is easier to map that 0, 1, 2, etc. correspond to 1, 10, 100, etc. That is especially helpful since we know that 1 + 1/theta is the "crowding factor" - how many X more crowded cases are than expected under a Poisson process.

- [x] consider dropping the LRT pane from fig 2, and instead marking significant changes in theta on the theta time series. Otherwise the reader is left scratching head trying to remember what a 'significant' LRT is and then mapping that to where changes are; so it makes the fig a bit dense.

- [x] use barblots for incidence in fig1? superimpose a red line showing the template curve? If you do this, it would also help this figure serve as an "explainer" figure for readers who aren't immediately clear on what the analysis is. Basicially a picture that illustrates the difference between variability in incidence (akin to variance) and the incidence 'trend' (akin to the mean)

- [x] I worked on the abstract but did not really touch the author summary. If you like the direction the abstract went, can you revise the author summary as needed so it is aligned? I read through it and I thought it was pretty close already.
