(A great deal of research has addressed the statistical question of assessing whether a count dataset has significant deviations from a homogeneous Poisson distribution44,47,48. After reviewing the performance of numerous possible test statistics47, we selected the PotthoffWhittinghill ‘index of ersion’ test, which is asymptotically locally most powerful against the negative binomial alternative48. For a dataset X with N elements, this statistic is (N– 1)*var(X)/mean(X) and its asymptotical distribution is chi-squared with N–1 degrees of freedom. A p-value is obtained by determining the cumulative density of the chi-squared(N–1) distribution to the right of the test statistic, and represents the probability that the observed variance arose by chance from a Poisson distribution. )

-Because the NB model is selected for several datasets, they comparison through gamma dispersion parameter

	abstract = {Two key linked questions in population dynamics are the relative importance of noise vs. density-dependent nonlinearities and the limits on temporal predictability of population abundance. We propose that childhood microparasitic infections, notably measles, provide an unusually suitable empirical and theoretical test bed for addressing these issues. We base our analysis on a new mechanistic time series model for measles, the TSIR model, which captures the mechanistic essence of epidemic dynamics. The model, and parameter estimates based on short-term fits to prevaccination measles time series for 60 towns and cities in England and Wales, is introduced in a companion paper. Here, we explore how well the model predicts the long-term dynamics of measles and the balance between noise and determinism, as a function of population size. The TSIR model captures the basic dynamical features of the long-term pattern of measles epidemics in large cities remarkably well (based on time and frequency domain analyses). In particular, the model illustrates the impact of secular increases in birth rates, which cause a transition from biennial to annual dynamics. The model also captures the observed increase in epidemic irregularity with decreasing population size and the onset of local extinction below a critical community size. Decreased host population size is shown to be associated with an increased impact of demographic stochasticity. The interaction between nonlinearity and noise is explored using local Lyapunov exponents (LLE). These testify to the high level of stability of the biennial attractor in large cities. Irregularities are due to the limit cycle evolving with changing human birth rates and not due to complex dynamics. The geometry of the dynamics (sign and magnitude of the LLEs across phase space) is similar in the cities and the smaller urban areas. The qualitative difference in dynamics between small and large host communities is that demographic and extinction-recolonization stochasticities are much more influential in the former. The regional dynamics can therefore only be understood in terms of a core-satellite metapopulation structure for this host-enemy system. We also make a preliminary exploration of the model's ability to predict the dynamic consequences of measles vaccination.},

A country’s position on this “canonical path” is driven by both measles control activities and demographic factors, which combine to change the effective size of the measles-susceptible population, thereby driving the country through theoretically established dynamic regimes. Further, position on the path to elimination provides critical information for guiding vaccination efforts, such as the age profile of susceptibility, that could only otherwise be obtained through costly field studies or sophisticated analysis. Equipped with this information, countries can gain insight into their current and future measles epidemiology and select appropriate strategies to more quickly achieve elimination goals.},

	abstract = {Spread of HIV typically involves uneven transmission patterns where some individuals spread to a large number of individuals while others to only a few or none. Such transmission heterogeneity can impact how fast and how much an epidemic spreads. Further, more efficient interventions may be achieved by taking such transmission heterogeneity into account. To address these issues, we developed two phylogenetic methods based on virus sequence data: 1) to generally detect if significant transmission heterogeneity is present, and 2) to pinpoint where in a phylogeny high-level spread is occurring. We derive inference procedures to estimate model parameters, including the amount of transmission heterogeneity, in a sampled epidemic. We show that it is possible to detect transmission heterogeneity under a wide range of simulated situations, including incomplete sampling, varying levels of heterogeneity, and including within-host genetic diversity. When evaluating real HIV-1 data from different epidemic scenarios, we found a lower level of transmission heterogeneity in slowly spreading situations and a higher level of heterogeneity in data that included a rapid outbreak, while R0 and Sackin’s index (overall tree shape statistic) were similar in the two scenarios, suggesting that our new method is able to detect transmission heterogeneity in real data. We then show by simulations that targeted prevention, where we pinpoint high-level spread using a coalescence measurement, is efficient when sequence data are collected in an ongoing surveillance system. Such phylogeny-guided prevention is efficient under both single-step contact tracing as well as iterative contact tracing as compared to random intervention.},

Quantifying heterogeneity is important as it affects other parameter estimates, it modulates the degree of unpredictability of an epidemic, and it needs to be accounted for in models of infection control. Aggregated data such as incidence time series are often not sufﬁciently informative to estimate k. Incorporating phylogenetic analysis can help to estimate k concurrently with other epidemiological parameters. We have developed an inference framework that uses particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo to estimate k and other epidemiological parameters using both incidence time series and the pathogen phylogeny. Using the framework to ﬁt a modiﬁed compartmental transmission model that includes the parameter k to simulated data, we found that more accurate and less biased estimates of the reproductive number were obtained by combining epidemiological and phylogenetic analyses. However, k was most accurately estimated using pathogen phylogeny alone. Accurately estimating k was necessary for unbiased estimates of the reproductive number, but it did not affect the accuracy of reporting probability and epidemic start date estimates. We further demonstrated that inference was possible in the presence of phylogenetic uncertainty by sampling from the posterior distribution of phylogenies. Finally, we used the inference framework to estimate transmission parameters from epidemiological and genetic data collected during a poliovirus outbreak. Despite the large degree of phylogenetic uncertainty, we demonstrated that incorporating phylogenetic data in parameter inference improved the accuracy and precision of estimates.

For COVID-19, kt declined over time and was significantly associated with increasingly stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions though similar evidence for SARS was inconclusive. Underdetection of sporadic COVID-19 cases led to a moderate overestimation of kt, indicating COVID-19 heterogeneity of could be greater than observed.

Repetition of experiments in space and time provides an estimate of this variability at specific scales, but does not explain how changes in variance generate structure in assemblages and the extent to which variance and mean intensity interact. This paper seeks to identify suitable procedures for empirical analyses on the influence of variance and mean intensity of predictor ecological variables on spatial and temporal patterns in natural populations. A survey of the ecological literature indicates that temporal variability in studies of disturbance and in analyses of consumer–resource interactions is generally expressed in terms of frequency of events. This is inappropriate, as frequency confounds the variance with the mean effect size of a process. A possible solution to the problem involves experimental designs in which levels of intensity and those of variability are chosen independently over explicit spatial or temporal scales and treated as fixed, orthogonal factors. Examples are offered for various scenarios of consumer–resource interactions along with indications for statistical tests of hypotheses. Such novel approaches have important ramifications for understanding variability in a wide range of ecological contexts and for predicting the response of assemblages to increased environmental fluctuations, including those expected under modified climate conditions.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive characterization of non-Poissonian, bursty temporal patterns observed in various natural and social processes is crucial for understanding the underlying mechanisms behind such temporal patterns. Among them bursty event sequences have been studied mostly in terms of interevent times (IETs), while the higher-order correlation structure between IETs has gained very little attention due to the lack of a proper characterization method. In this paper we propose a method of representing an event sequence by a burst tree, which is then decomposed into a set of IETs and an ordinal burst tree. The ordinal burst tree exactly captures the structure of temporal correlations that is entirely missing in the analysis of IET distributions. We apply this burst-tree decomposition method to various datasets and analyze the structure of the revealed burst trees. In particular, we observe that event sequences show similar burst-tree structure, such as heavy-tailed burst-size distributions, despite of very different IET distributions. This clearly shows that the IET distributions and the burst-tree structures can be separable. The burst trees allow us to directly characterize the preferential and assortative mixing structure of bursts responsible for the higher-order temporal correlations. We also show how to use the decomposition method for the systematic investigation of such correlations captured by the burst trees in the framework of randomized reference models. Finally, we devise a simple kernel-based model for generating event sequences showing appropriate higher-order temporal correlations. Our method is a tool to make the otherwise overwhelming analysis of higher-order correlations in bursty time series tractable by turning it into the analysis of a tree structure.},

	abstract = {COVID-19 reaffirms the vital role of superspreaders in a pandemic. We propose to broaden the research on superspreaders through integrating human mobility data and geographical factors to identify superspreading environment. Six types of popular public facilities were selected: bars, shopping centres, karaoke/cinemas, mega shopping malls, public libraries, and sports centres. A historical dataset on mobility was used to calculate the generalized activity space and space–time prism of individuals during a pre-pandemic period. Analysis of geographic interconnections of public facilities yielded locations by different classes of potential spatial risk. These risk surfaces were weighed and integrated into a “risk map of superspreading environment” (SE-risk map) at the city level. Overall, the proposed method can estimate empirical hot spots of superspreading environment with statistical accuracy. The SE-risk map of Hong Kong can pre-identify areas that overlap with the actual disease clusters of bar-related transmission. Our study presents first-of-its-kind research that combines data on facility location and human mobility to identify superspreading environment. The resultant SE-risk map steers the investigation away from pure human focus to include geographic environment, thereby enabling more differentiated non-pharmaceutical interventions and exit strategies to target some places more than others when complete city lockdown is not practicable.},

	abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of ﬁtting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasiPoisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

Starting with relatively familiar maximum likelihood methods-Poisson and negative binomial regression-I then introduce the less well known (and less well understood) quasi-likelihood approach. This method (like negative binomial regression) allows one to model overdispersion, but it can also be generalized to deal with autocorrelation. I then investigate the small-sample properties of these estimators in the presence of overdispersion and autocorrelation by means of Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, I apply these methods to the analysis of data on the foundings of labor unions in the U.S. Quasi-likelihood methods are found to have some advantages over Poisson and negative binomial regression, especially in the presence of autocorrelation.},

	abstract = {A long-standing question in infectious disease dynamics concerns the role of transmission heterogeneities, which are driven by demography, behavior, and interventions. On the basis of detailed patient and contact-tracing data in Hunan, China, we find that 80\% of secondary infections traced back to 15\% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) primary infections, which indicates substantial transmission heterogeneities. Transmission risk scales positively with the duration of exposure and the closeness of social interactions and is modulated by demographic and clinical factors. The lockdown period increases transmission risk in the family and households, whereas isolation and quarantine reduce risks across all types of contacts. The reconstructed infectiousness profile of a typical SARS-CoV-2 patient peaks just before symptom presentation. Modeling indicates that SARS-CoV-2 control requires the synergistic efforts of case isolation, contact quarantine, and population-level interventions because of the specific transmission kinetics of this virus.},

	abstract = {We propose a new statistical test for assessing differential gene expression using RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) data. Commonly used probability distributions, such as binomial or Poisson, cannot appropriately model the count variability in RNA-Seq data due to overdispersion. The small sample size that is typical in this type of data also prevents the uncritical use of tools derived from large-sample asymptotic theory. The test we propose is based on the NBP parameterization of the negative binomial distribution. It extends an exact test proposed by Robinson and Smyth (2007, 2008). In one version of Robinson and Smyth’s test, a constant dispersion parameter is used to model the count variability between biological replicates. We introduce an additional parameter to allow the dispersion parameter to depend on the mean. Our parametric method complements nonparametric regression approaches for modeling the dispersion parameter. We apply the test we propose to an Arabidopsis data set and a range of simulated data sets. The results show that the test is simple, powerful and reasonably robust against departures from model assumptions.},

But these aspects can not completely be assessed from aggregate data or macroscopic indicators such as the effective reproduction number. We propose in this paper an index of effective aggregate dispersion (EffDI) that indicates the significance of infection clusters and superspreading events in the progression of outbreaks by carefully measuring the level of relative stochasticity in time series of reported case numbers using a specially crafted statistical model for reproduction. This allows to detect potential transitions from predominantly clustered spreading to a diffusive regime with diminishing significance of singular clusters, which can be a decisive turning point in the progression of outbreaks and relevant in the planning of containment measures. We evaluate EffDI for SARS-CoV-2 case data in different countries and compare the results with a quantifier for the socio-demographic heterogeneity in disease transmissions in a case study to substantiate that EffDI qualifies as a measure for the heterogeneity in transmission dynamics.},
